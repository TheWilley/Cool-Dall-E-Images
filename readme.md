# Cool Dall-E Images
Some cool images generated by Dall-E 

## Compression
I've included a compression library as images generated by Dall-E have a big file size when generating `1028 x 12028` images. You need `Node.js` installed, then:

1. Install dependencies
   ```
   $ npm i
   ```
2. Run compression script:
   ```
   $ npm run compress
   ```

A folder called `compressed` will be created inside the `dist` folder, containing the compressed images.
